# COS470 - Information Retrieval: Lab & Assignment Code

## Overview
This repository consists of a collection of codes required by the COS 470 class. Code is primarily done in Python, and I have been switching between Google Colab and Junyper for my workspace. Most code should work independently, however some lab files require additional external files accessible through the class Brightspace.
